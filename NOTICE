The following files are derivative works from ```MEGA-GNN``` (Multigraph Message Passing with Bi-Directional Multi-Edge Aggregations, Bilgi et al.) and remain licensed under Apache 2.0:
- ``load_data.py``: we integrated temporal feature extraction and symbolic rule generation (temporal_feature_extraction, detect_outliers, extract_outliers, compute_rule_vectors, create_dgl_graph, create_symbolic_rules, substitute_features)
- ``models.py``: we incorporated timestamp information into edge features for temporal message passing.
- ``train_utils``.py: we computed new metrics for model evaluation
- ``training_node.py``: we inserted a mechanism to monito the best model based on validation perfprmance
- ``training_edge``.py: we inserted a mechanism to monito the best model based on validation perfprmance

The content of ``data_util.py`` is taken from ```MEGA-GNN```. We selected relevant modules and did not insert any own content. They remain licensed under Apache 2.0
